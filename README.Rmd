The goal of rcompilertools is access work with R's bytecode. Not a lot to see at the moment.

## Installation

``` r
remotes::install_github("dirkschumacher/rcompilertools")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(rcompilertools)

some_code <- quote({
  x <- 1
  for (i in 1:10) x <- x + 1
  x
})

opcode_table(some_code)
```

You can also get all OP codes

```{r}
opcodes()
```

* How to I access the constant pool?
